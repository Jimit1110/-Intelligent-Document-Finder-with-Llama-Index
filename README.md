The Intelligent Document Finder project aims to create a seamless, user-friendly platform 
that allows for the uploading and automatic indexing of various document formats, 
including PDFs, PPTs, Word documents, and other forms of unstructured data. By 
leveraging Llama Index for data indexing and retrieval, the system will enable precise query
